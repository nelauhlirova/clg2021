        <h2 class="amsterdam-about-heading">WHAT TO EXPECT IN AMSTERDAM</h2>

        <p class="amsterdam-about-text">
            Amsterdam has a fascinating history and is part of the reason this city is on so many travelers’ bucket lists. It’s truly one-of-a-kind, and offers so many different kinds of experiences. Here are some things you should know before traveling to Amsterdam: <br>
            <b>Language:</b> The official language is Dutch, but nearly everyone speaks English as a second language. <br>
            <b>Currency:</b> The Euro! <br>
            <b>Credit Cards and Banks:</b> Pretty much all restaurants and hotels will accept credit/debit cards. As of 2018, you can only use a debit or credit card to purchase public transportation tickets! <br>
            <b>Climate:</b> You can visit Amsterdam year-round and have a great experience, but the winter months (November through March) may be too cold for walking or cycling around the city. You’ll find the warmest months in Amsterdam to be June through September, but they are also the highest months for tourism! <br>
            <b>Stopovers:</b> Many travelers have layovers and stopovers in Amsterdam when connecting to other European destinations. It’s just a 15-minute train ride from the Schiphol Airport to Amsterdam’s Central Station.</p>

        <h2 class="amsterdam-info-heading">GETTING AROUND IN AMSTERDAM</h2>

        <p class="amsterdam-info-text">
            Amsterdam has impressive public transportation and offers travelers bicycles, metros, buses, ferries and trains to help you get around the city and beyond. Getting around Amsterdam is also very cheap, just a Euro or two per ride, so you have lots of options! <br>
            <b>Bicycle:</b> Most locals use bikes to get around. There are a LOT of bicycles, so be prepared for lots of bike traffic, but you can easily rent one (for about $10-12 Euros) for your time there. <br>
            <b>Helpful Tip:</b> As a pedestrian, cyclists have the right of way– so watch out! <br>
            <b>Walking:</b> Most places you’ll want to visit in Amsterdam are relatively close together. Obviously a bus or metro will get you around much quicker though. <br>
            <b>Public Transport:</b> You’ll find that getting around quickest can take a combination of bus, metro and tram rides. Luckily, the GVB offers daily transportation passes, available for 1 to 7 days, with prices starting from €7.50 Euros, and are valid for use on all three types of transport. This is definitely your best best if you’re in the city for a few days.
