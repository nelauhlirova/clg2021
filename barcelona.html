        <h2 class="barcelona-info-heading">GETTING AROUND IN BARCELONA</h2>

        <p class="barcelona-info-text">
            Barcelona is separated into many different districts and neighborhoods; each offering a unique flavor of the
            city! The most popular communities worth visiting are: <br />
            <b>Ciutat Vella:</b> Also known as the Gothic Quarter or heart of Barcelona, this is the oldest part of the city
            incorporating the popular area of Las Ramblas. Las Ramblas is usually filled with tourists, as it is the
            central most boulevard which cuts through the heart of the city. Visit the museum, showcasing the first
            Roman foundations, and enjoy the superb seafront with its boardwalk and beach.<br />
            <b>L’Eixample:</b> Outside the original city walls, this area of the city is where many of the best modernist
            architecture is to be found. It is also home to many of the best bars and clubs in the city.<br />
            <b>Gracia:</b> Having once been a Catalan town on the outskirts of the city, the growth of Barcelona has seen the
            area become a suburb, with a significant student population and the beautiful architecture of Gaudi’s Park
            Guell.<br />
            <b>Eixample:</b> Some of Barcelona’s best shopping is found in this area, and it is home to Gaudí’s Casa Batlló,
            Casa Mila and Sagrada Familia. There are tons of bars and restaurants in this district as well.<br />
            <b>Sants-Montjuic:</b> A nice open area with several lovely parks, this area offers amazing views of the city when
            you get to the top of the mountain. It’s also close to many of the Olympic facilities and is home to the
            high speed train station with links to the rest of the country.<br />
